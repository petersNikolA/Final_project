# Final project for programming course
MIPT, first course, autumn 2020.

Biatlon game made with python

## What is it game about?

The aim of this game is to gain points as much as possible in limited time. The gameplay is divided in two parts: 
* moving the skier so he could pass the obstacles and get to the end of the screen
* pinpoint firing in the clay pigeon
There is no wining or losing in this game, but you can compete with others in amount of points

## What are the rules?

* Press "space" when the arrow on the "speed-strip" is in the midlle of it. If you miss the center, the velocity will decrease(the further away from the center, the more velocity will decrease)
* Hitting the obstacle decreases skier's speed (use jump("arrow-up" button) to pass through them)
* Pick up "boost" to increase your speed
* While shooting, you should pay attention on wind and dispersion
* When the time is up - game over!

*Have fun!*
